# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi, I'm Joseph Jang. I just got off the waitlist for this class and joined late, so I hope that my submission will still be accepted. I really like to play open world games such as Terraria. I'm taking this class because I want to be a game developer in the future even though I have no prior experience. I want to make open world role playing games in the future.

6. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I'm a little nervous about workload and adjusting to college life in general.
